# Cortex C++ Client
The purpose of the project is to develop a C++ library for requesting the position of the objects to the server of the motion vision Cortex. This library is built with [Boost.Asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) and [Boost.Thread](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/thread.html) so it should work both on linux or windows machine.

**This project is in development mode so everything is not yet ready and doesn't yet work.**
